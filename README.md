*** This repo contains different basic algorithm implementaion of Machine Learning. This is all the LAB WORK at UPES's ML course. ***
algorithm implementations are as follows - 
1. Simple Linear Regression 
2. Multiple Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression 1
4. Logistic Regression 2
5. Knn implementation
6. Bayesian Classification
7. Support Vector Machine (SVM) implementation
